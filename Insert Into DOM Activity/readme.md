Working With The DOM In JavaScript

Creating a TO-DO List
JavaScript allows you to manipulate the DOM to add, remove, or update any element on a web page.

In this activity, the browser displays a list of TO-DO items.

A user can add items to this list by typing in the input box and clicking on the Add button. Every time the button is clicked, the function addItem() is called.

Your task is to implement the function addItem() that adds a new item to the list of TODOs.

Check inside the insertDOM.js for stepwise instructions and hints to help you along the way.

Hint: You can use DOM methods to identify the existing elements on a page and create or append a new one.

Hint: You can reference the MDN documentation on appending elements to the DOM for some extra guidance: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild.

Note: Alternately, you can use a conditional if() statement inside the addItem() function to check if the user didn't type anything in the input box and display an alert indicating that they need to type in a value.
